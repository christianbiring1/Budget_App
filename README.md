# Budget App

> Description of the project.
This project is about building a mobile web application where the user can manage their budget: they have a list of transactions associated with a category, so that they can see how much money they spent and on what.

I had to create a Ruby on Rails application that allows the user to:

* register and log in, so that the data is private to them.
* introduce new transactions associated with a category.
* see the money spent on each category.

## Built With

* Ruby on Rails
* CSS
* PostgreSQL
